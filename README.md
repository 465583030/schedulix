schedulix
=========

schedulix is an open source enterprise job scheduling system.
Instructions for compilation and installation can be found in doc/installtion_en.pdf (English)
or doc/installation.pdf (German).

At the moment we are working on the translation of the German documentation into English.
The documentation for the GUI is expected to be ready within a one or two weeks.
But you can have a look at a pre-release:

http://www.independit.de/Downloads/bicsuite_web_en-2.5.1.pdf

This is the documentation of the BICsuite ENTERPRISE edition, which offers a superset
of functionality. Still, most of it also applies to schedulix.

As soon as all the documentation has been translated, we'll branch the repository and start
some new developments. The actual HEAD revision is the stable V2.5.1 release and apart from 
the documentation only bugfixes are made.

All the progress will be twittered (https://twitter.com/schedulix).

Happy Hacking :-)
