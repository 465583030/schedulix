The last stable branch is v2.6
It can be obtained by doing a

git clone https://github.com/schedulix/schedulix.git -b v2.6

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Important notice:
Due to a changed read strategy in the code generated by jflex 1.6.0, we cannot recommend
to use this version of jflex at the moment, unless you like code digging or deadlocks. 

After contacting the jflex guys, the flaw has been fixed. This fix will be part of jflex 1.6.1.
It will also be part of the current development release (soon).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There has been made a change to the table SCOPE. The length of the passwd column has been
extended to 64 characters.
This means that you'll have to change this in the database schema when upgrading.

Happy Hacking :-)
